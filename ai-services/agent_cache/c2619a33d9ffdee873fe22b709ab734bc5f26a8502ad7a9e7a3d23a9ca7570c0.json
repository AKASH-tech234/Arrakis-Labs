{
  "explanation": "The submission result indicates \"Verdict: Accepted\" and \"Error Type: None\". This means the provided solution successfully passed all test cases for Problem ID 732. Therefore, the solution did not fail.",
  "improvement_hint": "Since the solution was accepted, it is already correct. A general improvement for accepted solutions, especially with array constraints up to 10^5, is to always consider the time and space complexity of your approach. Even if the current solution passed, exploring more optimal algorithms (e.g., O(N) or O(N log N) for array problems) can lead to more robust and performant solutions for larger or more stringent test cases.",
