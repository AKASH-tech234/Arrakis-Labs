  "rationale": "The `mid_boundary_violation` error in a divide and conquer problem indicates an issue with how the `mid` index is calculated or how the array is partitioned into subproblems for recursive calls. This often leads to incorrect array indexing, out-of-bounds access, or improper coverage of the input range, resulting in a `wrong_answer`. Carefully review your `mid` calculation and how the array indices are passed to recursive calls to ensure all elements are covered exactly once without going out of bounds."
