  "explanation": "The submission failed with a 'Wrong Answer' due to a 'Logical Error'. In Divide and Conquer problems, this often indicates an issue with the recursive logic itself, such as incorrectly defined base cases, an improper division of the problem into subproblems, or an error in how the results from subproblems are combined to form the final solution. Given the constraints, the error is likely in the correctness of the algorithm rather than its efficiency.",
  "improvement_hint": "Carefully review your recursive function's base cases and the logic for combining the results from the subproblems. Manually trace the execution with a small, representative input, paying close attention to how values are processed and merged at each step.",
