{
  "summary": "The submission for problem 'test-prob-1' (Category: Arrays) resulted in a 'Wrong Answer'. This indicates that the implemented logic does not correctly handle all test cases, possibly due to an oversight in edge cases or a fundamental flaw in the algorithm's approach.",
  "strengths": [
    "Successfully submitted code, demonstrating basic understanding of problem input/output and the coding environment."
  ],
  "improvement_areas": [
    "Thoroughly review the algorithm's logic for correctness across various scenarios.",
    "Develop a comprehensive set of test cases, including edge cases like empty arrays, single-element arrays, arrays with duplicate values, and arrays at the maximum constraint size, to thoroughly validate the algorithm's correctness.",
    "Pay close attention to array indexing and boundary conditions."
