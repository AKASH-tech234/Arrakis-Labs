  "explanation": "The 'mid_boundary_violation' verdict indicates an issue with array indexing or boundary handling, which is common in divide and conquer algorithms. This typically means that an array access occurred at an invalid index, or the recursive calls were made with incorrect 'low', 'mid', or 'high' parameters. This can lead to out-of-bounds access or an infinite recursion if the 'mid' index is not calculated or used correctly to shrink the problem space.",
  "improvement_hint": "Carefully re-evaluate the calculation of the 'mid' index and how the array is partitioned into subproblems. Ensure that the 'mid' index is calculated robustly (e.g., `low + (high - low) / 2`) and that the recursive calls correctly define non-overlapping and exhaustive sub-ranges (e.g., `[low, mid]` and `[mid+1, high]`) to prevent off-by-one errors or infinite recursion.",
