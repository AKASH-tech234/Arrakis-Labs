{
  "summary": "The submission for `check_sorted_dc_edgecase` resulted in a `wrong_answer` due to a `mid_boundary_violation`. This indicates an error in how array indices, specifically the `mid` point, are calculated or used within the divide-and-conquer algorithm, likely leading to incorrect partitioning or out-of-bounds access.",
  "strengths": [
    "Consistent engagement with `divide_and_conquer` problem types."
  ],
  "improvement_areas": [
    "Carefully re-evaluate the calculation of your `mid` index and how it defines the ranges for your recursive calls to ensure no off-by-one errors or out-of-bounds access."
  ],
  "recurring_patterns": [
    "A recurring challenge in `divide_and_conquer` problems related to precise handling of boundary conditions and simplifying recursive logic, as evidenced by a previous 'Simplify logic and retry' mistake in the same category."
