  "rationale": "The submission resulted in a wrong_answer due to a mid_boundary_violation. This error is critical in divide and conquer problems, indicating an issue with correctly calculating midpoints or handling array indices and boundaries during recursive calls or base cases. The user needs to solidify their understanding of these fundamental aspects. Actionable hint: Carefully review how the midpoint is calculated and how array ranges are split and passed to recursive calls, paying close attention to inclusive/exclusive boundaries."
