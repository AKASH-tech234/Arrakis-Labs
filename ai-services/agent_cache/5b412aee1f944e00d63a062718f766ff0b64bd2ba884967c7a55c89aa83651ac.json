  "explanation": "The submission received a 'Wrong Answer' verdict, indicating that the C++ code produced incorrect output for one or more test cases. Given the 'Hard' category of the problem and the large constraints on input values (up to 10^9 for T and nums[i]) and array length (up to 10^5), common reasons for such failures include: 1) Integer overflow or underflow if intermediate calculations exceed the capacity of standard integer types, necessitating the use of `long long`. 2) Flaws in the core algorithm's logic that fail to correctly handle specific input scenarios or edge cases. 3) A subtle misinterpretation of the problem statement's requirements or constraints.",
  "improvement_hint": "Carefully re-evaluate the data types used for all variables involved in calculations or comparisons, especially sums, differences, or products, to ensure they can accommodate the full range of values specified in the constraints (up to 10^9) and prevent potential integer overflows. Additionally, manually trace your algorithm's logic with a few diverse test cases, including edge cases like `k=1`, `k=nums.length`, arrays with all identical values, and arrays containing the minimum/maximum allowed values, to pinpoint where the current logic might deviate from the expected behavior.",
  "detected_pattern": "The user has a recurring pattern of past mistakes related to 'Carefully re-read the problem description... manually trace the logic... edge cases...' for Easy problems. This suggests a general weakness in thoroughly understanding problem requirements and validating code against diverse test cases, which is even more critical for a 'Hard' problem where subtle details and edge cases can easily lead to incorrect solutions."
