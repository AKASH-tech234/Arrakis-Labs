{
  "summary": "The user attempted a 'Hard' category problem and received a 'Wrong Answer' verdict. This indicates a potential issue with the correctness of the implemented logic, possibly stemming from an incomplete understanding of problem requirements or insufficient testing, particularly of edge cases. This aligns with a recurring pattern observed in previous submissions.",
  "strengths": [
    "Demonstrates willingness to tackle challenging problems by attempting a 'Hard' category problem.",
    "Utilizes C++ for problem-solving, indicating familiarity with a performant language."
  ],
  "improvement_areas": [
    "Meticulously re-read problem descriptions to ensure a complete understanding of all requirements and constraints before implementation.",
    "Develop a systematic approach to manually trace code logic with diverse test cases, including edge cases (e.g., minimum/maximum array lengths, extreme value ranges, identical elements).",
    "Enhance debugging skills to pinpoint logical errors that lead to incorrect outputs."
  ],
  "recurring_patterns": [
    "A consistent pattern of overlooking specific problem requirements or failing to adequately test edge cases, which has previously led to incorrect solutions on 'Easy' problems and now appears to be a factor in a 'Hard' problem submission."
