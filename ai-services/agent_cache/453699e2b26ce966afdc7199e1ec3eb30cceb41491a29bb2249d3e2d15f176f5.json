  "explanation": "The \"Wrong Answer\" verdict indicates that the submitted Python solution produced an incorrect output for at least one of the test cases. In array-related problems, this often stems from a logical flaw in the algorithm's core logic, an incorrect handling of specific input scenarios (such as edge cases), or subtle off-by-one errors in array indexing or iteration. Given the problem category and the absence of a specific error type, it's highly probable that the solution's logic does not correctly cover all possible valid inputs, leading to an incorrect result for certain inputs that differ from the ones tested during development.",
  "improvement_hint": "To diagnose and fix \"Wrong Answer\" in array problems, it is crucial to systematically test the solution against a comprehensive set of edge cases. This includes, but is not limited to, arrays with minimum size (e.g., empty or single-element arrays), arrays where all elements are identical, arrays with elements at the extreme ends of their possible value range, and arrays where the expected result is located at the very beginning or end. Manually tracing the code's execution with these specific inputs can often reveal where the current logic fails to produce the correct output.",
